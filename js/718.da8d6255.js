Of all the New Year’s resolutions being made, going on a diet is almost always at the top of the list. Unfortunately, many fall by the wayside half-way through this resolution. Chalk it up to being tempted by luscious, mouth-watering foods or to pure laziness but people almost always fall off the wagon when it comes to dieting. Fad diets do not help either as they just increase the food cravings and bring back the weight with a vengeance. So how do we address this issue? Luckily, there’s one diet that allows you to eat to your heart’s content and still let you lose weight. It even lets you eat fat – but not the kind of fat that walks on all fours and wallows in the mud. No, it is the good kind of fat in this diet known as the Keto Diet. <br data-v-9a49f35a><br data-v-9a49f35a>  The Keto or Ketogenesis Diet is also known as the low carb or low carb high fat diet. Simply put, you either stop eating carbs or lower your carbohydrate intake and eat more fats. How does this work? Well, when you eat more foods that are high in carbohydrates, your body will produce glucose and insulin. This glucose will be used as a primary source of energy so the fats will not be needed and is stored away. Leaving you with a body full of unused fat which makes for a chubby you. However, if you lower your intake of carbohydrates and increase your intake of fat, your body will be induced into a state known as ketosis. Ketosis is a natural process in the body that happens when the food intake is low. Ketosis is initiated to help the body survive. During this state, the body produces ketones which are produced from the breakdown of fats from the liver. <br data-v-9a49f35a><br data-v-9a49f35a>  The good kind of fat can truly help you lose weight by triggering ketosis. The right kind of fat actually helps you lose a lot of weight. Fats such as avocado, hard cheeses, high fat cream, butter, spinach, kale, broccoli, cauliflower, macadamias, walnuts, sunflower seeds, coconut oil, high-fat salad dressing, and saturated fats are all what dieticians call good fats. However, your diet should still be well-rounded so don’t just eat the good fats exclusively. Your diet should be 70% fats, 25% protein, and 5% carbohydrate. <br data-v-9a49f35a><br data-v-9a49f35a>  Aside from losing weight though, these good fats also offer benefits such as: <br data-v-9a49f35a><br data-v-9a49f35a>  Mental Focus – Ketones are a good brain food. Big spikes in blood sugar are avoided when you lower your carbohydrate intake thus resulting in improved focus and concentration. <br data-v-9a49f35a><br data-v-9a49f35a>  Increased Energy and Normalized Hunger – Research show that fats are more effective to be burned by the body as fuel. In giving your body a better fuel to burn throughout the day, you will feel more energized and alert. <br data-v-9a49f35a><br data-v-9a49f35a>  The Ketogenic Diet has a lot of promise to it so give it a try. </p><br data-v-9a49f35a><br data-v-9a49f35a><h6 data-v-9a49f35a><strong data-v-9a49f35a>Elizabeth Bennet</strong> is highly opinionated and loves to read.
