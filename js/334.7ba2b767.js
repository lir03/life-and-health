The plant was seen as a precursor to bad actions and decisions. Almost all violent crimes were attributed to the use of cannabis. However, times have changed and research has shown that cannabis, surprisingly, has some medically beneficial effects through its THC and THCa. Especially its THCa. What is THC and THCa anyway? Generally speaking, THC and THCa are both compositions found in cannabis. One is found in raw cannabis while the other is found when the cannabis is heated after a long period of time.

Through decarboxylation, which is a chemical reaction that removes a carboxyl group and releases carbon dioxide, THC appears. Simply put, when you smoke or vape cannabis, THC forms and is the cause for the euphoric high people get after smoking cannabis. THC is responsible for marijuana’s psychological effects. It gives the feelings of overwhelming joy and confidence one feels after smoking the weed. THC gives you the high or euphoria that can in turn cause hallucinations, anxiety, and delusions.
