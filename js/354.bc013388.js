It is sold as THCa tincture or THCa crystalline. Truefarma.com sells THCa tincture in limited quantities as it is a popular item so they limit the product to two tinctures per customer per week. Treatwell Health which is based in California also sells THCa tincture. THCa crystalline comes from isolating THCa from a cannabis plant so it will be small enough to fit into pills since it has been ground into a powder form. Also, juicing raw cannabis is rapidly growing popular these days. Juicing raw cannabis ensures that you get the full benefits of THCa. Most people say, juicing raw cannabis is the only way to go as it is more potent because you are actually using the leaves and it has not been ground into powder which is the case with the THCa crystalline nor has it been made into an oil as in the case of the THCa tincture. ",-1))),b=i((()=>(0,s._)("h2",null," Which is better?",-1))),H=i((()=>(0,s._)("p",null,"  With all this research on THC and THCa, how does one decide which to use? Which is better, THC or THCa? Well, some research has pointed out that THC and THCa complement each other but THCa has more benefits than THC. THCa is potent and raw and gives a lot of benefits that have been well researched already, such as strengthening the immune system and helps you get a good night’s rest. When all is said and done, it all depends on what you are going to use the cannabis for and for what purpose. If you are just in it for the high, then use THC but if you want to cure an illness or to have a stronger immune system, then use THCa. There are a number of people who are just using marijuana for the high, as in those in parties who are looking for a good time. However, it is more likely that THCa is gaining ground. The use of medical marijuana is slowly getting steam and its supporters have been growing as of late. Proven effects and benefits of THCa is slowly getting around and will gain more traction as the years go by. A lot of people are now looking to THCa to cure their illness and maladies. Strictly speaking, it is better to use THCa as it has proven benefits compare to THC. Besides, THC has also side-effects such as slowing down reaction time, impair day to day functionality, and increase depression. Taking all these into consideration, it is much better to use THCa than THC.
