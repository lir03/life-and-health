Science and technology has given us botox, age-defying moisturizers, and vitamins and medicines that keep us in the pink of health. But the truth is, there’s no sure-fire way to live longer. That, however, doesn’t mean you can’t add a few precious years to your life. Here we list down 10 easy ways to do that. </p><h2 data-v-559d62f9>Laugh!</h2><p data-v-559d62f9>  This one is a no-brainer. How often have we heard that laughter is the best medicine? It helps ease tension, sadness, and anger. It could also do wonders for our abs because according to US cardiologist Dr. William Fry, 100 to 200 laughs are equivalent to 10 minutes of jogging or rowing. That’s good news for people who can never find the time to (or just won’t) exercise. </p><h2 data-v-559d62f9>Live in the country</h2><p data-v-559d62f9>  Being a city mouse has its perks: you get a higher pay (more often than not), have access to most everything you need, etcetera, etcetera. But all those luxuries coupled with an on-the-go lifestyle can take its toll on your health in the form of heart attacks, asthma, and stress. Research has shown that people living in the country have a significantly higher life expectancy than their counterparts who live in the city. A study from the Tokyo Medical and Dental School found that those live near green open spaces tend to live much longer than those stuck in the concrete jungle. </p><h2 data-v-559d62f9>Sleep</h2><p data-v-559d62f9>  Do we even have to spell this out? Dozing off to la-la-land is a necessity because it gives your body and your heart time to recuperate from all the beatings it took from the moment your alarm sounded to the time you arrived back home. Six to eight hours of uninterrupted sleep will result to more energy and a stronger immune system. </p><h2 data-v-559d62f9>Be positive</h2><p data-v-559d62f9>  According to researchers, having a positive attitude can add more than seven years to your life. That means you need to look more often at the bright side of things, see the glass half-full, and so on. </p><h2 data-v-559d62f9>Find God</h2><p data-v-559d62f9>  According to a study published in the International Journal for Psychiatry and Medicine, going to church increases life expectancy. Having a deep sense of faith showed a decrease in people’s stress and emotional problems. </p><h2 data-v-559d62f9>Have a pet</h2><p data-v-559d62f9>  Animal lovers are more likely to live longer compared to people who never had any pet. According to Alan Beck, Director of the Center for the Human-Animal Bond at Purdue University, contact with companion animals triggers a relaxation response. Pets, especially dogs, help make you feel happy and relaxed, which in turn lowers your blood pressure. </p>",16),g=[v],m=i((()=>(0,o._)("div",{class:"col-md-3 rightad"},null,-1)));function y(e,t,i,v,y,w){const b=(0,o.up)("next-button"),k=(0,o.up)("router-link"),x=(0,o.up)("text-button");return(0,o.wg)(),(0,o.iD)("div",s,[(0,o._)("div",r,[d,(0,o._)("div",l,[(0,o.wy)((0,o._)("img",{class:"article",alt:"Decoding the Fountain of Youth",src:a(4480)},null,8,h),[[n.F8,!y.isHidden]]),(0,o._)("div",c,[u,(0,o._)("div",p,[(0,o.Wm)(k,{to:"/decoding-the-fountain-of-youth-p2"},{default:(0,o.w5)((()=>[(0,o.Wm)(b)])),_:1})]),(0,o.Wm)(x,{class:"textButton",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=e=>y.isHidden=!y.isHidden)}),(0,o.wy)((0,o._)("div",f,g,512),[[n.F8,y.isHidden]])])]),m])])}var w={data(){return{isHidden:!1}}},b=a(3744);const k=(0,b.Z)(w,[["render",y],["__scopeId","data-v-559d62f9"]]);var x=k},4480:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"img/10 ways to live longer-1.7abc9ca1.webp"}}]);
