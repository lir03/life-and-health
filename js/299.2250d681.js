What happens to the remaining 90%? Where does it go? The answer: nowhere. Sad, isn’t it? Good thing there’s sudoku, the Rubik’s cube, chess, and even crossword puzzles that help stop the brain from eventually dying. But playing these games is only half of how to keep the brain in tip-top condition. The other half comes from eating the right food. <br data-v-0a961c25><br data-v-0a961c25>  Just as there are food for the heart and body, there is also food for the brain. Below is a list of those that have been proven to maintain and enhance the brain’s productivity and keep the juices flowing. </p><h2 data-v-0a961c25>Fish</h2><p data-v-0a961c25>  For all you carnivores out there, let me make this as painless as possible. No, you don’t need a radical change in your diet; all you need to do is eat one fish meal a week. A study conducted by the Rush Institute for Healthy Aging in Chicago found that people who eat at least one fish meal a week are significantly less likely to end up with Alzheimer’s disease. <br data-v-0a961c25><br data-v-0a961c25>  Omega-3 fatty acids and fish oil help improve memory performance and learning acquisition, and aids in the prevention of dementia and Alzheimer’s. It also contains iodine, which is known to improve mental clarity. <br data-v-0a961c25><br data-v-0a961c25>  Wild salmon, sardines, and herring are the best sources as they have been shown to contain the highest levels of Omega-3, fish oil, and iodine. And by wild, we do mean the fish was caught in the big sea and was not farm-raised.
