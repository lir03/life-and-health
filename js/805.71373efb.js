It is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid found in raw and live cannabis. It is in the raw form of cannabis so one doesn’t get “stoned” or high when eating raw cannabis. THCa has a lot of benefits that some people juice the raw cannabis to get the benefits of THCa. In analysis, THCa is safer than THC as it does not give any not so good psychological effects such as the euphoric high that in turn leads to hallucinations and delusions. </p><h2 data-v-d7e981dc> THC vs. THCa</h2><p data-v-d7e981dc>  So, is there any difference between THC and THCa or are they basically the same? Actually, THC and THCa are kind of linked together because THC is what you get when you heat THCa. Though, the difference between THC and THCa is one, as mentioned earlier, THC is the cause for the euphoric high you get while THCa does not get you high. Another big difference is that THCa is found in the raw form of cannabis while THC is found when cannabis is heated. Also, THCa is a bigger compound than THC. </p><h2 data-v-d7e981dc> All the goodness of THCa</h2><p data-v-d7e981dc>  THCa has numerous benefits that has been unearthed through research.
