It’s summertime once again and a lot of people are hanging outdoors and going to the beach. Unfortunately, other than us spending time at the beach, there is also one species that we do not want to cross paths with that is hanging out at the beach and those are hookworms. <br data-v-7e4cac28><br data-v-7e4cac28>  Sure, it’s great to take a leisurely stroll along the beach but we should take precautions also. There was one report about a teenage kid in a Florida beach who got hookworms. His friends buried him in the sand and after a while, he got itchy and got wounds on his body. The doctors diagnosed him with a case of hookworms. He is now being treated and is on his way to recovery. <br data-v-7e4cac28><br data-v-7e4cac28>  The story of that kid should all be a precautionary tale to all of us. Just because we are on the beach doesn’t mean we are out of any danger. There is still a lot of threats on the beach, despite its relaxing and calming aura. Summertime should be a time of fun. It is not meant to be spent in a hospital room. </p><h2 data-v-7e4cac28>What are hookworms</h2><p data-v-7e4cac28>  Hookworms are tiny parasites or worms that live in your small intestine and bring problems to your gut. They are responsible for your feelings of pain, anemia, and diarrhea. There are some people who think that these parasites are responsible for stopping the immune system from overreacting. <br data-v-7e4cac28><br data-v-7e4cac28>  People become infected with hookworms when they are in contact with a sand or soil that is infected with feces that have hookworm eggs. They originally come from dog or cat feces who are already infected with hookworm. </p><h2 data-v-7e4cac28>Who is at risk?</h2><p data-v-7e4cac28>  Children are at great risk for hookworms as they love playing in the soil and sometimes this soil is unsanitary and they don’t wash their hands. Others who are at risk are gardeners who work on the soil without any gardening gloves, sunbathers because sometimes the hookworm can still wriggle their way through a beach towel, and utility workers. </p><h2 data-v-7e4cac28>Natural prevention to avoid hookworm</h2><p data-v-7e4cac28>  Getting hookworms can be very scary. It’s enough to get you paranoid when going to the beach. Rest assured though that as long as the beach is sanitary and clean then there is no way you can get hookworms. However, there are some places where there are dogs and cats roaming on the beach. That’s the time you should exercise extra caution. <br data-v-7e4cac28><br data-v-7e4cac28>  Here are some natural prevention to avoid hookworm: </p><ul data-v-7e4cac28><li data-v-7e4cac28>Wear slippers while walking on the beach.</li><li data-v-7e4cac28>Lie on blankets when lying down on the sand.</li><li data-v-7e4cac28>Wash with soap after getting in contact with sand</li></ul><p data-v-7e4cac28>  Make sure your next visit to the beach is a fun and memorable vacation by being extra careful when you come in contact with the sand. Always be vigilant when you are on the beach to avoid getting sick. Just because you are on vacation doesn’t mean you should throw all caution to the wind. </p><br data-v-7e4cac28><br data-v-7e4cac28><h6 data-v-7e4cac28><strong data-v-7e4cac28>Anne Shirley</strong> loves Octobers and believes that imagination makes life wonderful.
