Bringing home unfinished work means less time for relaxation and sleep and an increase in stress. </p><h2 data-v-89302d08> Nurture your relationships</h2><p data-v-89302d08>  Life becomes easier and more enjoyable when shared with people you love. Forming and taking care of your relationships—with your friends, your spouse, your family—is beneficial to your overall well-being. These people give you much-needed mental and emotional support. </p><h2 data-v-89302d08> Play mind games</h2><p data-v-89302d08>  We mean the literal kind—the one that involves hours of staring at a paper and figuring out the word or the number in a crossword or Sudoku puzzle. “Whatever your age, ongoing mental stimulation will keep your brain [from] building new spines on the dendrites of your brain cells,” says Dr. Thomas Crook, author of The Memory Cure. Taking up a new hobby and learning a new skill such as playing the piano can also do wonders for your brain. </p><h2 data-v-89302d08> Don’t overeat</h2><p data-v-89302d08>  Obesity is a swift way of shortening your lifespan: it increases your risk for heart disease and cancers of the colon, womb, gall bladder, ovaries, and breast. According to the British Heart Foundation, coronary heart disease causes 270,000 heart attacks each year, and of these 28,000 are attributed to obesity. So don’t eat like there’s no tomorrow! </p><br data-v-89302d08><br data-v-89302d08><h6 data-v-89302d08><strong data-v-89302d08>Florence Danaya Blythe</strong> is a lover of life.
